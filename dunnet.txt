Dunnet is a surreal, cyberpunk text adventure written by Ron Schnell, 
based on a game he wrote in 1982. The name is derived from the first 
three letters of dungeon and the last three letters of Arpanet. 
It was first written in Maclisp for the DECSYSTEM-20, then ported to 
Emacs Lisp in 1992.[3] Since 1994 the game has shipped with GNU Emacs;
it also has been included with XEmacs.

To run Dunnet, simply type: 

emacs -batch -l dunnet 

in the terminal.
